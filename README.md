# [Spherically Symmetric Scalar Field in double-Null coordinates](https://github.com/eschnett/sssfn)

A Haskell playground based on [Soham
Mukherjee](https://github.com/soham1112)'s spacetime discretization
project.

- idea: rewrite G22 after solving G01
- constraints are not symmetric?
- todo: test dual numbers
- todo: test derivative operators
- todo: test grid and operator indexing
- after one step residual of w should be all zero
